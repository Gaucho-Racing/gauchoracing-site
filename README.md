## Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.ico
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   ├── pages/
│   │   └── index.astro
│   └── style/
│       └── demo-styling.css
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components or layouts.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Testing

### Included Default Testing

We’ve included some tooling that helps us maintain these templates. This template currently uses:

- [Renovate](https://www.mend.io/free-developer-tools/renovate/) - to regularly update our dependencies
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) - to run tests against how the template runs in the browser
- [Cypress Netlify Build Plugin](https://github.com/cypress-io/netlify-plugin-cypress) - to run our tests during our build process

If your team is not interested in this tooling, you can remove them with ease!

### Removing Renovate

In order to keep our project up-to-date with dependencies we use a tool called [Renovate](https://github.com/marketplace/renovate). If you’re not interested in this tooling, delete the `renovate.json` file and commit that onto your main branch.

### Removing Cypress

For our testing, we use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for end-to-end testing. This makes sure that we can validate that our templates are rendering and displaying as we’d expect. By default, we have Cypress not generate deploy links if our tests don’t pass. If you’d like to keep Cypress and still generate the deploy links, go into your `netlify.toml` and delete the plugin configuration lines:

```diff
[[plugins]]
  package = "netlify-plugin-cypress"
-  [plugins.inputs.postBuild]
-    enable = true
-
-  [plugins.inputs]
-    enable = false 
```

If you’d like to remove the `netlify-plugin-cypress` build plugin entirely, you’d need to delete the entire block above instead. And then make sure sure to remove the package from the dependencies using:

```bash
npm uninstall -D netlify-plugin-cypress
```

And lastly if you’d like to remove Cypress entirely, delete the entire `cypress` folder and the `cypress.config.ts` file. Then remove the dependency using:

```bash
npm uninstall cypress
```
