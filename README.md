### This is the website for UCSB SAE.
## Things to consider:
- Adding a reflective layer to the 3d model to improve lighting
- The responsiveness is buggy for short and wide displays like the samsung fold.
- Using draco gltf compression to improve the load time
- Using as little javascript as possible

This website is hosted at ucsbgauchoracing.com

This website is built using ReactJS and AstroJS.

This is the mirror of https://github.com/minhbui27/astro-gauchoracing, as I didn't want to delete my current Netlify setup, so I will push to this often rather than using this as my main repo.

If anyone would like to collaborate, please shoot me a message!
